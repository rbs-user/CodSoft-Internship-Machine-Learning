## **Task 1: Movie Genre Classification**

**Objective**:  
To predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information.  

**Methodology**:  
1. Preprocessed the text data using **TF-IDF** to represent plot summaries as numerical vectors.  
2. Implemented multiple classifiers, including **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.  
3. Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.  

**Results**:  
Successfully trained a classifier that can accurately predict the genre of a movie based on the given textual data.

## **Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Objective**:  
To detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.  

**Methodology**:  
1. Preprocessed the dataset by handling class imbalance using techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).  
2. Built classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**.  
3. Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance and evaluated the models using metrics like AUC-ROC, accuracy, and F1-score.  

**Results**:  
Achieved a robust fraud detection model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall.

## **Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction**

**Objective**:  
To predict whether a customer will churn based on historical customer data.  

**Methodology**:  
1. Analyzed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.  
2. Implemented models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Gradient Boosting** to classify customer churn.  
3. Performed feature selection to identify key factors contributing to customer churn.  

**Results**:  
Developed an accurate model for predicting customer churn, aiding in identifying at-risk customers for retention strategies.

## **Task 4: Spam SMS Detection**

**Objective**:  
To classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.  

**Methodology**:  
1. Preprocessed text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and transforming it using **TF-IDF**.  
2. Built classifiers like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.  
3. Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable spam detection.  

**Results**:  
Successfully developed an AI model capable of accurately identifying spam messages.
